# The Holistic Educator: A Description

- The final version of this project will be an application that teachers can use to track connections they make with students in order to inform the support they provide students for social-emotional development or behavioral concerns.
- This project is near and dear to me as a huge advocate for social-emotional learning in schools. This application is a tool that many teachers who are tracking their connections with students will find helpful to ensure that they are reaching every student.
